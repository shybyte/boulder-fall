# Boulder Fall - Game

The code of this game is an alternative refactoring of the game in https://www.manning.com/books/five-lines-of-code.

The original code can be found here: https://github.com/thedrlambda/five-lines/blob/main/index.ts.
This refactoring is proposed in the book: https://github.com/thedrlambda/five-lines/blob/solution/index.ts

Please compare this code with my [solution](./src/index.ts).
